# Practice Project: Stock Price Analysis & Prediction  
Explore stock market and we will try to predicting future stock prices through Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method. 
- Companies: 
    - NVIDIA (NVDA) – Semiconductors and AI.
    - AMD (AMD) – Also in semiconductors and a close competitor to NVIDIA.
    - Intel (INTC) – Another major semiconductor player.
    - TSMC (TSM) – The leading semiconductor manufacturer, crucial for companies like NVIDIA and AMD.

Question we will try to answer:
1. What was the change in price of the stock over time?
2. What was the moving average of the various stocks?
3. What was the daily return of the stock on average?
4. What was the correlation between different stocks?
5. How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
6. How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior? (Predicting the closing price stock price of Nvidia using LSTM)

Note: Companies are most in US and one is TM. However, the absolute price is not relevent in this context, so no need to convert TSMC from NTD to USD.
